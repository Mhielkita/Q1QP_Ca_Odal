            <h1 class="intro4"> AGE OF RESPONDENTS </h1>
            <p> We wanted to know how old the respondents are. This helps us see if there are differences in social media use based on age. The variable in the spreadsheet is identified as “Age” as the variable we are finding in the question is the age of the individual. We used the unit of measurement of “years” as age is most commonly measured with years. In the “Age” box and whisker plot, the median is the center of the box. This means that the distribution is symmetric. The whiskers are also the same length, meaning the distribution is symmetric. The interquartile range is the range between the first and third quartile. The interquartile range in this plot is the box, which measures 15 years to 15 years. The measure of the interquartile range interprets how spread the middle values are, since it measures from 15 to 15, the middle values are spread lower than the middle values of the "hours using social media per day" plot. The outliers, extreme values that differ from most points in the dataset, in the plot are the points outside the fences. In the plot, the fences are represented by the whiskers. Therefore any points outside the whiskers are outliers. Also note that the median, the first and third quartile, and the lower and upper fence are all the same value, which is 15. This means that the box and whiskers all fall into the 15 line.</p>
